# Our key questions that we hope to answer:
* Has the type of conflicts and/or severity changed over time (based on World Conflict data)?
* What are trends in conflict over time and what are trends in deaths over time?oDoes region and other categorical factors impact this?

# Data Title:  
ConflictPy 

# Subject:  
Civil War Indicators (Violent Acts Data)Data Source API:  https://ucdp.uu.se/apidocs/Initial 

# Thoughts:
The data source that we found has data from ~1946 to 2018 and more specific records from 1998 to 2018.  The api has several hundred thousand records.  We recognize that this is a very large dataset that may be too complicated if we do not narrow our focus.  The data set includes records that can go down to the event record but also has information that is summarized (filtered) by year, country, conflict, and conflict type.  Some of the specific records that in the json file include (beside the filter data information) deaths, death type, location, who caused the conflict, region.As we look at the api more, we are interested in pulling the data about the yearly data number of conflicts and number of deaths and can filter this data by conflict type.  Our initial plots we will generate will be number of conflicts by years (bar chart), number of conflicts by region, number of deaths by year, number of deaths by region, and number of conflicts by years filter by violence type.  We will continue to investigate the data further for other relationships.
